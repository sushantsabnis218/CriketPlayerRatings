Azhar's leg-side play was reminiscent of Zaheer Abbas and Greg Chappell - a Michelangelo in the midst of housepainters. In later years, he expanded his off-side repertoire, and conjured some of the finest innings played in the modern era - his 121 at Lord's in 1990 was one for the gods. His technique was suspect against the short stuff, a deficiency he sought to overcome through instinctive strokeplay, sometimes with cavalier disregard for the team situation. As captain, Azhar enjoyed tremendous success on made-to-order home pitches, while right to the end of his career he was peerless in the field, whether prowling the covers or pouching catches at slip. He announced his arrival, against England in 1984-85, with three hundreds in his first three Tests, a feat that has never been match, while his last Test innings also bore him a hundred. But then allegations of match-fixing provided an emphatic full stop. That he finished his career with 99 Tests is perhaps appropriate for one who came within a whisker of batting immortality - only to throw it all away at close of play. He appealed against the life ban in the courts but the verdict is still awaited. He made his foray into politics by joining the Congress party in 2009.

A tall offspinner, Ashwin opened the bowling for Chennai Super Kings, bowled at death, came on when wickets were required, and was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 played in South Africa. "", ' \n', ""Ashwin's success in T20 cricket earned him a call-up to the national side - ODI firsts and inevitably the Tests in 2011-12. He was a part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but rarely got a chance ahead of Harbhajan Singh. But, Ashwin kept on building a phenomenal body of work and his rapid development as a bowler coincided with Harbhajan's fading fortunes. "", ' ', ""Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test against West Indies, the second-highest by an Indian debutant after Narendra Hirwani's 16, and won the Man-of-the-Match award. It only got better from there: he registered nine five-fors in his first 16 Tests and in 2013, broke Erapalli Prasanna's Indian record for the fastest to 100 Test wickets by reaching the landmark in his 18th game. "", 'His carrom ball, an arm ball just as good, his control over his offbreaks, and a sharp brain has made Ashwin a quintessential limited-overs spinner. In Test cricket, however, he endured a brief period of struggle after not being able to replicate his success in subcontinental conditions overseas. In December 2013, Ashwin went wicketless for 36 overs in Johannesburg as India failed to bowl out South Africa, who nearly accomplished a chase of 458 in over four-and-a-half-sessions. He was made to sit out for six Tests after that, and when India went to Australia in late 2014, he was not picked for the first Test in Adelaide. ', ""Ashwin, however, effected minor tweaks to his bowling, mainly zeroing in on a comfortable action, and recaptured his glorious form to finish with 31 wickets in India's 3-0 series win against South Africa at home in November-December 2015. An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin is more than a handy lower-order batsman: he is correct, has the shots and scored two Test centuries. He had a decent outing in the 2016 World T20, but in a crucial moment in the semi-final, he overstepped and reprieved the dangerous Lendl Simmons, paving the way for West Indies' win and India's exit.

He made a name for himself as one of the tournament's premier allrounders, playing for Hyderabad Heroes and India XI. \n"", "" \nAfter two seasons in the unsanctioned tournament, Binny accepted the BCCI's amnesty offer and quit the ICL. He returned to the Karnataka squad and established himself as an important member of the side, often scoring runs in crisis situations and chipping in regularly as a partnership-breaker. He was picked in the India A squad for the tour of South Africa in 2013 and was rewarded with a national call-up later that year with the ODI squad to New Zealand. He had a solid domestic season in 2013-14, scoring 443 runs at 43.22 and taking 14 wickets at 32.64, playing a key role in Karnataka's storming run to the Ranji Trophy title.

There was little help for him on an uncharacteristically dry and slow track, and he finished wicketless in the 10 overs he bowled, but he played a crucial role with the bat in India's second innings, calming their nerves after a mini-collapse on the final day and helping save the Test with an innings of 78. Binny was dismissed cheaply in both innings of the second Test at Lord's, and was left out for the third and fourth Tests. He returned at The Oval, went wicketless again, and was the not-out batsman on 25 when India slumped to 94 all out in their final innings of the series."", "" \nBinny remained a regular in India's ODI squads, though his playing opportunities were limited. He went to the 2015 World Cup, but didn't get to play a match.

It would have been easy to dismiss him as a one-dimensional bowler after his forgettable debut. He erased the memories of being caned for 44 runs off his first four overs, and of two fruitless home Tests against New Zealand, when he emerged one of India's leading fast bowlers in their historic tour of Pakistan in 2003-04. He was particularly lethal in a couple of sessions in the third Test in Rawalpindi, where he consistently swung the ball away, and snapped up a then career-best 4 for 63. In addition, his uninhibited batting and a megawatt smile endeared him to crowds in a manner even he found difficult to fathom. \n"", 'That comeback fades in comparison to the one he made in 2008-09. A stress fracture ruled him out of cricket in 2005, and threatened to end his career. For three years he could hardly play any cricket. He had to undergo a back surgery before which he was not sure he would be able to bowl again. ""If I were to go back,"" WV Raman, the Tamil Nadu coach who supported him throughout the hiatus said, ""to what all happened when he was told he would have to go for a surgery, it would take me two days to rattle on."" With a remodelled action and the same unwavering spirit, he started the long road back through the first season of the IPL in 2008. His 11 wickets for Chennai Super Kings included a hat-trick. A successful Ranji season followed, and his 36 wickets at 17.50 took Tamil Nadu through to the semi-final. Eventually the national recall came, when Munaf Patel sustained a groin injury during the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka in January 2009. He then made it back to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, but never got a game. He captained the Tamil Nadu Ranji side, and reminded the selectors yet again that he wasn\'t a finished article, by bowling economically for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 IPL. He was rewarded with a call-up to the Twenty20 squad for the home series against New Zealand and the ICC World Twenty20. ', 'Before the injury struck he bowled with a whippy, quick-arm action and had the ability to bowl quicker deliveries, yorkers or bouncers without a perceptible change in action. His open-chested action, combined with a tendency to bowl wide from the crease, lulled batsmen into believing that the ball would come in with the arm. As a result of this, when the ball swung away, or even straightened, he could be difficult to tackle. Not much of that has changed in his remodelled action. The perceptible change is in the way he starts his run-up, where he sort of tiptoes for the first few steps - almost as if unsure of the ground he is going to run on, before easing in.

In comparison 2006-07 was not as spectacular, but Badrinath managed 436 runs at almost 50.

In October  he was called up to the ODI squad for the last three one-dayers against Australia, though he did not get a game. He was dropped for the series against Pakistan that followed.  He shrugged off the disappointment by performing well in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy season, scoring 659 runs at 65.90.

Upright, and given to scoring in the V, Badani proved adept at remaining not out, and his high point was a wonderfully paced hundred against Australia at Pune in 2001-02. Subsequently his form became patchy and he was edged out of the squad as other youngsters seized their day.

His progress into the national side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, Dravid established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation that were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique drilled into him by Keki Tarapore, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while the flair players expressed themselves. Yet, for a man quickly stereotyped as one-paced and one-dimensional, he too could stroke the ball around when the mood struck him. \n', ""Never a natural athlete, he compensated with sheer hard work and powers of concentration that were almost yogic. At Adelaide in 2003, when India won a Test in Australia for the first time in a generation, he batted 835 minutes over two innings. A few months later, he was at the crease more than 12 hours for the 270 that clinched India's first series win in Pakistan.\nInitially seen as a liability in the one-day arena, he retooled his game over the years to become an adept middle-order finisher. The heaves and swipes didn't come naturally, but by the time the selectors eased him aside in early 2008, he had more than 10,000 runs to his name in the 50-over game. There had also been a lengthy phase where he donned the wicketkeeping gloves, helping the team to find a balance that was crucial in the run to the World Cup final in 2003."", ""However, it's his Test exploits that he will be most remembered for. After impressing in a Lord's debut where he was eclipsed by Sourav Ganguly, Dravid's breakthrough innings arrived at the Wanderers a few months later, against a South African attack accustomed to bullying visitors. A brief slump followed, but he emerged from that with perhaps one of the most famous supporting acts of all, to VVS Laxman in an Eden Gardens Test that rejuvenated Indian cricket. The half decade that followed was a golden one with the bat, as tours of England and Australia realised more than 600 runs."", ""A two-year stint as captain, following Ganguly's axing, was less successful, though he did lead the side to series victories in England and the West Indies for the first time in a generation. Just when it seemed his best was behind him, Dravid showed his class once again on the tour to England in 2011. In a series in which India were completely outplayed and none of their other batsmen scored more than 275 runs in the Tests, Dravid amassed 461, including three hundreds, two of them when opening the innings against a high-quality pace attack. However, that was followed by a poor series in Australia, which turned out to be his last, as he announced his retirement soon after returning to India."", ""Dravid's immense levels of concentration also came in handy when he was standing in the slips.

At 31, Dighe had all but given up hopes of a career in cricket and was studying in the USA when the call came. Shortly after the Indian team's departure to Australia in the 1999-2000 season, Dighe was picked to don the gloves in the one-dayers. In the limited-overs games he played, Dighe bagged seven catches and one stumping in eight matches. In one game against Pakistan, Dighe shone with four catches. However, it was not until Australia toured India in 2000-01 that Dighe got his first taste of Test cricket. Playing the decisive third and final Test\nagainst Australia at Chennai, Dighe had an ordinary time behind the wickets. However, with the Test winding to an exciting climax, Dighe found himself at the crease with the tail on the final day. Batting through a tense session that saw Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie steaming down, Dighe made a courageous unbeaten 22 as India recorded a historic 2-1 series win. At the preparatory camp for the Indian tour of Zimbabwe, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly remarked that Dighe would be India's first choice wicketkeeper. The skipper stayed true to his word and Dighe was picked as stumper for the Tests and one-dayers in Zimbabwe in mid 2001. Without being spectacular, Dighe performed his duties satisfactorily keeper and batsman. Promoted to open the innings in the second innings of the second Test at Harare, Dighe managed just 4. However, his ability with the bat came to the fore in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup in Zimbabwe, when the Mumbaikar slammed an unbeaten 94 in a losing cause against the West Indies.

He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007."", ' \n', 'Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23 when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi in 2004. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.', ""Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected. He improvised, he learned, but didn't make an apology about his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He still batted with low, hockey hands, he still didn't look elegant but became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes."", ""Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year."", ""Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue against the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni, and that Dhoni has for years been among the best few ODI batsmen in the world."", ""However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, reality struck, and an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to win four wins in a series. "", '  ', ""Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body.\n \nWins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Virat Kohli. "", 'Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth and final Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format.\n \nThough his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper, with 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. ', 'Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners and indicated he could yet play on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017. ', ' ', 'Dhoni has also found a new home in the IPL, having been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise for the first eight seasons of the tournament, leading them to two titles and four runner-up finishes. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise. But in 2016, with Super Kings suspended for two seasons, he became the first player signed up by the new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.']","['ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2008', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2009', 'ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2011', ""LG People's Choice Award 2013""]",90,144,16,4876,224,38.09,8249,59.11,6,33,544,78,256,38,341,289,82,10500,183*,50.72,11992,87.55,10,71,806,224,314,120,98,85,42,1617,56,37.6,1282,126.13,0,2,116,52,57,34,131,210,19,7038,224,36.84,,,9,47,,,364,57,414,356,97,13080,183*,50.5,,,17,85,,,395,138,303,271,110,6205,79*,38.54,4573,135.68,0,24,429,272,160,78,90,7,96,67,0,,,,4.18,,0,0,0,341,2,36,31,1,1/14,1/14,31,5.16,36,0,0,0,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,131,,126,87,0,,,,4.14,,0,0,0,414,,63,53,2,1/14,1/14,26.5,5.04,31.5,0,0,0,303,1,12,25,0,,,,12.5,,0,0,0

Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history.  \n"", ""When he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope. "", ""The beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid. "", ""His gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He  ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home.

For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.', 'He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.\n', ""After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side. "", ' ', 'With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until an England tour in 2014 when he was called-up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after four innings. Gambhir was on far firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US $2.4 million in the 2011 auction.

Like the great tall wristspinners Bill O'Reilly and his own idol BS Chandrasekhar, Kumble traded the legspinner's proverbial yo-yo for a spear, as the ball hacked through the air rather than hanging in it and came off the pitch with a kick rather than a kink. The method provided him stunning success, particularly on Indian soil, where his deliveries burst like packets of water upon the feeblest hint of a crack, and more than one modern-day batsman remarked that there was no more difficult challenge in cricket than handling Kumble on a wearing surface. \n"", ""Kumble's prodigious capacity to bear pain was proved in Antigua in 2002 when he bandaged his fractured jaw to deliver a stirring spell, and that to continuously learn in the mid-2000s when, after a decade of middling away performances, he influenced memorable wins in Headingley, Adelaide, Multan and Kingston, using an improved googly, bigger sidespin and more variation in flight and on the crease."", ""In a brilliant though always downplayed career Kumble claimed virtually every Indian record. In 1999 in Delhi he swallowed all ten wickets in an innings against Pakistan. In December 2001, on home turf in Bangalore, he became the India's first spinner to take 300 Test wickets. A year later, almost to the day, he became the first to do so in one-dayers. In August 2007 at The Oval he went past Glenn McGrath's 563 wickets and in January 2008 he broke the 600 barrier, to stand behind only Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, emphasising his contribution to spin's golden era.

A stable head, sure footwork and firm wrists are part of Kohli's arsenal, which helps him play an array of audacious shots."", ""Fluent all around the ground, Kohli is equally confident off the front and back foot.

Kohli could not believe that Dhoni would no longer wear whites, and that he would now lead India. The second thought made him cry. ""If you told me when I started playing cricket that at 26 I will be Test captain of India... no chance,"" is how he later described his feelings.', '""A brat, arrogant and casual"" was how Kohli described himself in 2008, when he then became the second India captain to lift the Under-19 World Cup. He excelled in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, which put him on the world map and made sponsors line up at his doorstep, making him a brand even before he had established himself in international cricket. But as he steadily grew to become India\'s most dependable batsman, and not just a brand, Kohli realised he needed to rid of old, bad habits. He lost weight, gained focus and became a relentless force, supremely fit and quick across the turf, and perhaps the hungriest batsman in the world when it comes to converting ones into twos.', 'The IPL helped Kohli, like many other Indians, play positively. He is certain that his 52-ball 100* in a chase of 360 against Australia in the Jaipur ODI of 2013 (still the fastest by an Indian) was only possible because of his post-IPL mindset. In 2016, Kohli smacked four centuries in the tournament, having not scored even a single ton in his first eight seasons. When Royal Challengers finished as runners-up in 2016, Kohli was just 27 runs short of reaching an unprecedented 1000 runs for the season.', 'Kohli has played with men who presented him awards when he was a chubby-faced schoolboy, and some of the same men have ended up playing under his captaincy. Under Kohli, India have ascended to the No. 1 Test ranking and held onto it with an iron grip while also reaching the joint top position in ODIs.

He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.\n\xa0 \n', ""Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries. He was all promise ever since he bowled Steve Waugh with a full delivery in the Champions Trophy in 2000.

Every comeback ended in a frustrating setback through a new injury."", '\xa0\nIn 2006, though, Zaheer, now with a shorter run up, a fitter body and a meaner mind, dazzled England with 78 wickets for Worcestershire, where team-mates started calling him \'Zippy Zakky\'. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth in South Africa, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a match-winning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil. The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called ""my greatest cricketing moment.""', ""\nZaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12. But a hamstring injury on the very first day led to India losing one of their premier match-winners, and also every one of those matches. It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas. At 35 years, he still had all the tricks but his pace was down and he looked rather spent even while playing the second of back-to-back Tests in Durban.\n\xa0"", 'There was no doubting how much Zaheer prized Test cricket though.

However, his record with the ball in ODIs, his fielding, and his rocket arm made him a valuable player in shorter formats, which showed when Chennai Super Kings paid $2 million to secure his services. In August 2013 he topped the ICC's ODI bowling rankings, becoming the first Indian to do so since Anil Kumble in 1996."", '\nShane Warne, his IPL captain at Rajasthan Royals, nicknamed Jadeja ""rockstar"" because of his confidence in his own ability, but his utility lies in his ability to do the dirty work. He is unerring in his accuracy, can bowl overs and overs without tiring, and maximises the natural variation available in the pitch. His fielding and his batting made him an easy pick as a third spinner in Tests in India, a ploy that worked like a charm in India\'s 4-0 win against Australia in early 2013. Clarke, one of the better players of spin going around, will testify, as will 24 wickets at 17.45 in what was his first full series.\xa0', ""\nWhen R Ashwin suffered a dip in form, Jadeja became India's lead spinner on the tours of South Africa and New Zealand in 2013-14 and the first part of their England tour of 2014. While he had his moments, such as a six-for in Durban and a breezy, match-turning 57-ball 68 at Lord's, his bowling was one-dimensional and rarely penetrative on most of the surfaces India encountered. He sat out the fifth Test of the England tour, and flew home early from the Australia tour of 2014-15 with a shoulder injury."", ""\nJadeja's bowling lacked both the accuracy and the bite of old when he returned for the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that his shoulder had still to recover fully. He was left out of the ODI side that toured Zimbabwe in in July 2015, and though it was a second-string squad, the selectors confirmed that Jadeja had been dropped and not rested."", '\nBack in domestic cricket, Jadeja made sure the selectors could not ignore him while picking the squad for the upcoming home Tests against South Africa. In his first three matches of the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season, all in Rajkot, on dustbowls prepared to maximise the threat of his bowling, he picked up six successive five-wicket hauls - apart from scoring two half-centuries - for Saurashtra. The surfaces that hosted the four Tests against South Africa gave lavish assistance to the spinners, and Jadeja was close to unplayable at times while picking up 23 wickets at 10.82 to help India to a 3-0 series win.', '\nWith the Super Kings franchise suspended for two seasons, the nuts and bolts of the team were dismantled ahead of the 2016 IPL season, with Jadeja finding a new home at Gujarat Lions.\n']",[],41,60,14,1485,100*,32.28,2299,64.59,1,10,149,40,31,0,151,101,33,2035,87,29.92,2416,84.23,0,10,155,37,53,0,40,18,6,116,25,9.66,124,93.54,0,0,6,2,18,0,94,138,22,5415,331,46.68,8868,61.06,10,25,577,97,82,0,204,145,45,3084,134,30.84,3574,86.28,2,15,231,64,75,0,213,151,52,2153,48,21.74,1761,122.26,0,0,151,73,78,0,41,78,11480,4548,192,7/48,10/154,23.68,2.37,59.7,7,9,1,151,147,7669,6245,174,5/36,5/36,35.89,4.88,44,7,1,0,40,40,811,983,31,3/48,3/48,31.7,7.27,26.1,0,0,0,94,168,23448,9538,402,7/31,13/126,23.72,2.44,58.3,17,27,7,204,195,10044,7936,235,5/36,5/36,33.77,4.74,42.7,10,1,0,213,185,3296,4258,137,5/16,5/16,31.08,7.75,24,3,1,0

However, with two giant spinners - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh - at the peak of their powers, there wasn't a place available for him in India's squad. \n"", ""Mishra made his international debut in 2003 during an ODI triangular in Bangladesh, but he had to wait until 2008 to get his first go in Tests. That opportunity came after an injury forced Kumble out of the Mohali Test against Australia. Mishra had a dream start to his Test career, becoming the sixth Indian to take a five-wicket haul on debut, foxing the Australians with his variations and finishing the series with 14 wickets from three Tests. With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order. "", ""Mishra's struggles in international cricket aside, he has remained a vital cog for the Haryana Ranji side over the years, collecting a bagful of wickets. But, it's his performances in the IPL, where he has been one of the best spinners, and the only bowler to pick up three hat-tricks, that keep him in the limelight. The hat-tricks came for three different teams - Delhi Daredevils (2008), Deccan Chargers (2011) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013). In 2015, Mishra returned to the team he first played for, with Daredevils paying INR 3.5 crore to secure his services."", ""A strong display in the 2013 IPL, during which he kept the batsmen guessing with his variations in flight and pace, earned him a call-up for India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in England and the tour to Zimbabwe, almost two years after his last international appearance. He didn't disappoint, picking up 18 wickets at 11.61 in five ODIs against Zimbabwe, and equaling Javagal Srinath's record for the most wickets in a bilateral series. Mishra's good form continued into the World T20 the following year in Bangladesh, where he picked up 10 wickets at 14.70, while only conceding 6.68 runs per over, as India adopted a three-spinner strategy and finished runners-up to Sri Lanka."", ""With younger options thin on the ground, India recalled Mishra to the Test side for their 2015 tour of Sri Lanka. Playing Tests after a four-year gap, he complemented R Ashwin perfectly, picking up 15 wickets in three Tests at 15. The re-emergence of Ravindra Jadeja during the 2015-16 home series against South Africa restricted Mishra's involvement to only two of the four Tests, but he performed creditably on spin-friendly pitches, his seven wickets at 17.28 including the dismissals of AB de Villiers (twice), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis and JP  Duminy.

But with all those gifts came a curse - his brittle body, which may well have contributed to him playing his last Test in 2004. Still T20 cricket, which has a cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline and at 36 he revived his international career because he had reprised the ability to move the ball at 140 kph, and became one of India\'s most successful bowlers in the 2016 World T20.\n \nNehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace bowling list.\n \nThe high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he scalped 6 for 23 and then threw up by the side of the pitch. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia followed, and Nehra\'s status as an automatic pick was lost. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 and found his mojo again.\n \nHis 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 dismissals in 2010 to establish his place in India\'s 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.\n \nIt was long thought that was the end of Nehra, but he willed himself back into contention picking up 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015 - the most by an Indian fast bowler. ""I don\'t know what has happened. Whether it is my face, I don\'t know,"" he joked on being ignored by India\'s selectors in June. Six months later - and four years since his last appearance for India - he was brought back to the fold for a tour of Australia.

A swashbuckling opening batsman cast in the Mushtaq Ali mould, Srikkanth could destroy the strongest and most fearsome attacks in the world by fearless pulling, hooking and driving. But there were times when he could be dismissed by some pretty ordinary bowling. Gifted with a good eye and super-quick reflexes, Srikkanth's buccaneering methods quickly caught the eye of the selectors and he made his international debut at 21.

He was 57, and suffered from diabetes. Statistically, Solkar remains Test cricket\'s most successful fielder, with 53 catches in just 27 matches - of those who played at least ten, the nextbest is Bob Simpson\'s 110 in 62 Tests, or 1.77 per match to Solkar\'s 1.96. The top catchers are usually firmly camped in the slip cordon, but most of Solkar\'s came at forward short leg, where he lurked uncomfortably up close and personal to the batsman. Bishan Bedi, one of the great Indian spinners of the time whose menace was greatly enhanced by this, confirmed: ""His close-in catching was really intimidating. We would not have been the same bowlers without him."" Tony Greig, an opponent in the 1972-73 series in India, said: ""Ekki was the best forward short leg I have ever seen."" His catching was often preceded by some very idiosyncratic sledging. ""I\'ll get you, bloody,"" he advised Geoff Boycott, and he told Garry Sobers to mind his own business. Solkar rose from humble roots. His father was the groundsman at the Hindu Gymkhana in Bombay, and he grew up in a oneroom hut on the ground shared with his parents and five siblings (one of whom, Anant, also played first-class cricket). He impressed the Bombay players with his bowling in the nets, and turned himself into a handy all-rounder, allying adhesive batting to his enthusiastic left-arm seamers - for Indian Schools, who he captained despite his lowly birth; for Bombay, taking six for 38 on his Ranji Trophy debut in 1966-67; for Sussex in one match in 1969; and then for India. Some affectionately called him ""the poor man\'s Sobers"", but he outdid even him in India\'s victory in the West Indies in 1970-71, with six catches and a crucial 55 in the only definite result, India\'s win at Port-of-Spain. Later in 1971, he played an equally vital role in India\'s first Test and series victory in England, with 44 and three wickets in a famous triumph at The Oval. There were also three catches, one - in England\'s second-innings collapse to dispose of Alan Knott, who had made 90 first time around - as fine as any, when Solkar was stationed even closer than usual.', 'In the 1970s, when Indian cricket was hovering near the top of the world, the image of Eknath Solkar diving for a catch was as firmly embedded in the collective consciousness of a nation as Sunil Gavaskar\'s straight drive or the skills of India\'s spin quartet. ""We would never have been as effective without Solkar at short leg,"" Bishan Bedi once said.', ""Eknath Dhondu Solkar, who died of a heart attack aged 57, was sometimes called the `poor man's Garry Sobers' because he could bat anywhere, and bowl both medium-pace and spin. As a fielder, however, he held his own. When India beat West Indies for the first time ever, at Port of Spain in 1970-71, Solkar equalled the then world record of six catches in a Test."", ""His 53 catches came at almost two a match, the best ratio among fielders with over 50 catches. He toured the Caribbean and New Zealand in 1975-76 on the strength of his fielding alone, for by then Solkar the bowler had virtually ceased to exist, and as a batsman he was no longer `Mr Dependable'. "", 'So assured were Solkar\'s hands - he made catches where other fielders might  have seen barely a half chance - that, like a Bradman zero, a Solkar miss made the headlines when he was in his prime.

As an obdurate opening or middle-order batsman; as a left-arm spinner who was an integral part of the attack; and as long-time deputy to a couple of captains.  In his time he was very much the glamour boy of Indian cricket, tall and good-looking and with an image to match. He had his detractors who charged that he batted too slowly, that he was selfish in his approach, that he continued to be in the team only because Gavaskar was captain. But the phlegmatic Shastri took all this in his stride, letting his performances on the\nfield speak for themselves. In reality, as Shastri himself admitted, he was not particularly talented but had come up only through hard work. \n', ""Shastri might not have cut a dashing figure on the field as he pushed and prodded and grafted his way for runs and his bowling was little more than defensive as he pegged away on a good length without much variation. Of batsman who have played ten Test innings against Australia, only Eddie Paynter averages more than Shastri's 77.75. He was like Navjot Sidhu in reverse: he started off as a lower-order hitter, but ended up as the original stonewaller at the top of the order."", ""But no one could deny his immense value to the side, his commitment to the team's cause and his consistency had to be admired.

However, for a player of his class, the first six years of his international career were frustrating for him, the team, and the spectators, as the odd delightful innings was followed and preceded by plenty of failures. It all came together finally in 2013, when Rohit was promoted to open the innings in ODIs. The move turned out to be a masterstroke, as Rohit found form in the Champions Trophy, and then went into overdrive in the ODI series against Australia, scoring two centuries, including 209, only the third double in ODI cricket. That led to a place in the Test team, and Rohit responded by scoring centuries in his first two Test innings, becoming the fifth batsman to do so. A year later, he became the first batsman to hit two ODI double-hundreds, in an innings where he smashed the record for the highest score with 264 off 173 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.    \n', ""For the first six years of his career, though, Rohit struggled to come up with the sort of numbers which would justify his talent. He first came to limelight when he exuded class at No. 3 in the Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. He took that class with him when he played for India in their triumphant World Twenty20 campaign in 2007 and the CB Series in Australia in early 2008, scoring two fifties, including a vital 66 in the first final in Sydney. However that ability to look good at the crease didn't translate into long innings in his first two first-class seasons for Mumbai. He kept making strides in the big league, though. He was bought for US$750,000 by the Deccan Chargers in the IPL, and made 404 runs at 36.73 including four fifties. "", ""He pressed a claim for higher things through two centuries in the 2008-09 Ranji final, a feat last achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and only four others before him. However, his lack of consistency meant he wasn't a part of India's World Cup-winning squad, and returned to national duty only when the top players were rested on the tour to the West Indies in 2011. There, he made his presence felt with consistent scores in the ODIs and the Man-of-the-Series award. But his form continued to fluctuate in the months that followed, and he remained one of India's most promising but unfulfilled talents over the next couple of years. All that changed in 2013, and with Tendulkar retiring from Tests and ODIs that year, Rohit looked set to be a permanent fixture in the Indian team across formats."", ""Then came the 2015 World Cup and Rohit ended up as India's second-highest run-scorer, with an impressive 137 against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, further cementing his place in the top order. He added another feather to his captaincy hat when he led Mumbai Indians to their second IPL title in 2015.

His good looks (he was a pop singer and a film actor), aggressive batsmanship and a penchant for big hits made Patil a natural crowd puller. An instant success after making his Test debut and on his first tour, he took 174 off Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe at Adelaide. It was a remarkable innings given that in the previous Test he was concussed by a bouncer from Pascoe after scoring 65.  After a moderate series against England in 1981-82 he was dropped but was back for the tour of there in 1982. And at Old Trafford he came up with another memorable display, hitting an undefeated 129, in the process taking 24 runs (4440444) off an over from Bob Willis - the third delivery being a no ball. He did reasonably well on the tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 but because of personal problems he dropped out of the team to tour West Indies in 1983.  Back for the World Cup in 1983, Patil was one of the heroes of that triumph. But in the Tests against Pakistan and West Indies in 1983-84, his aggressive batting was laced with a bit of indiscipline and he could not maintain his place in the side.

By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name."", ""Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "", 'He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed.

"", 'His ODI career hit a peak when he helped India chase 316 with a blistering century against New Zealand in December 2010.

He scored a 21-ball 40 in the IPL semi-final in 2012 to help Knight Riders to their maiden final and eventually their first title. His other aggressive performances on the domestic circuit - a century in the 2012-13 Vijay Hazare Trophy, fifites in the Deodhar Trophy, some all-round displays in the Ranji Trophy, and a 15-ball fifty in IPL 2014 have been sporadic, not allowing him a place in a talented Indian limited-overs middle order.

Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark. \n', ' \nBut a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.', "" \nIrfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing. He played a big part in India's one-day and Test series wins on their revival tour of Pakistan in 2004."", ' \nHis batting soon took off and, under the management team of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, he was regularly pushed up the order in ODIs - with a promotion to No.3 immediately yielding a spectacular 83 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.', "" \nBut, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides."", ' \nRecalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90. His crucial spell of 3 for 16 in the final against Pakistan earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.', "" \nIrfan returned to the ODI side for the home series against Australia and Pakistan, and showed he had rediscovered his rhythm, based on which he was handed a recall in the third Test against Pakistan in Bangalore. He celebrated his comeback by making his first Test hundred. He was subsequently picked for the Test series in Australia, and came into the side for the third Test in Perth, where he played a crucial part in India's famous win - with five wickets and scores of 28 and 46 to claim the Man-of-the-Match award."", "" \nIrfan lost his place in the India squad in 2009 and subsequently struggled with loss of form and injuries. A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."", ' \nIrfan has played no international cricket since then, but remains, like his brother Yusuf, a sought-after name at the IPL. He has had stints at Kings XI Punjab, Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as an injury-ravaged 2015 season where he did not play a single game for Chennai Super Kings.

Then, even as Baroda and Gujarat vied for his services, Munaf chose Mumbai, after Sachin Tendulkar had taken special interest in him and had a word with the authorities in the Mumbai Cricket Association. Even then Munaf's first-class career was anything but smooth as he spent more time recovering from various injuries than actually playing. \n"", ""Strongly built though not overly tall, Munaf gradually gathers momentum in his approach to the crease, before releasing the ball with a windmill-whirl of the hands.

In Mohali a week later, he ended with 7 for 97, the best performance by an Indian fast bowler on Test debut. A consistent series against West Indies later that year meant Munaf had established himself as a regular member of the side. "", ""Then came the lull as Munaf, like most of India's new crop of fast bowlers, began to fade away after a good start. He lost pace at an alarming rate, and seemed intent on rebranding himself as back-up seamer as opposed to a pace spearhead. He soon lost his place in the Test side, and despite a handful of average ODI performances, was a left-field selection for the New Zealand tour in 2009. He did a reasonable job in India's win in Hamilton, but a schedule packed with the occasional home Tests in between ODIs and Twenty20s meant he rarely stayed in the radar for long. Injuries to Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth in the lead-up to the Sri Lanka tour in 2010 gave him another opportunity to impress."", ""Munaf's career continued to be dogged by injuries, but in an ironic twist, he was the beneficiary of one when Praveen Kumar was forced out of India's 2011 World Cup squad.

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more. \n"", 'As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.', ""His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones."", ""The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.

","[""\nSachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, the most prolific runmaker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known. His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.  \n"", ""There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both front foot and back, could tune his technique to suit every condition, temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world in all conditions."", 'Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the overwhelmingly dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in Australia. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batsman: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.', 'Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and armed with a loathing for losing, Tendulkar set about doing what it took to become one of the best batsmen in the world. His greatness was established early: he was only 16 when he made his Test debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.', ""He currently holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred till his 79th match. Incredibly, he retained a divine enthusiasm for the game till his last match. At 36 years and 306 days he broke a 40-year-old barrier by scoring the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, when just one month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which like Bradman's batting average, could be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, Tendulkar retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, on his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium against West Indies. "", ""Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectations he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who have been prone to regard anything less than a hundred in each innings as a failure. The aura may have dimmed, if only slightly, as the years on the international circuit took their toll on the body, but Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world.\n"", ' ']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1997', ""LG People's Choice Award 2010"", 'ICC Player of the Year 2010']",200,329,33,15921,248*,53.78,,,51,68,,69,115,0,463,452,41,18426,200*,44.83,21367,86.23,49,96,2016,195,140,0,1,1,0,10,10,10,12,83.33,0,0,2,0,1,0,310,490,51,25396,248*,57.84,,,81,116,,,186,0,551,538,55,21999,200*,45.54,,,60,114,,,175,0,96,96,11,2797,100*,32.9,2310,121.08,1,16,359,38,28,0,200,145,4240,2492,46,3/10,3/14,54.17,3.52,92.1,0,0,0,463,270,8054,6850,154,5/32,5/32,44.48,5.1,52.2,4,2,0,1,1,15,12,1,1/12,1/12,12,4.8,15,0,0,0,310,,7605,4384,71,3/10,,61.74,3.45,107.1,,0,0,551,,10230,8478,201,5/32,5/32,42.17,4.97,50.8,4,2,0,96,8,93,123,2,1/12,1/12,61.5,7.93,46.5,0,0,0

An ideal man for a crisis, Yashpal could blunt the edge of any attack with solid defence, and though he might not have been a very attractive batsman to watch, none could argue against his value to the side. A score of 173 for North Zone against South Zone in the Duleep Trophy in 1977-78 brought him close to national recognition. He toured Pakistan the following season but did not make the Test team. He did well on the England tour in 1979, scoring 884 runs (58.93), and played in three of the four Tests. He was a regular member of the team during the twin rubbers against Australia and Pakistan in 1979-80, making a number of valuable contributions including his maiden Test hundred against Australia in New Delhi. However, he lost his place after an indifferent showing in Australia and New Zealand the following season (though he did get 201 not out against Victoria). He bounced back against England in 1981-82 and scored 140 in Madras, sharing a record 316-run stand with GR Viswanath. The two batted throughout the second day's play. Yashpal remained a regular member of the team on the tours of England in 1982, and Pakistan and West Indies in 1982-83, always being a difficult batsman to dislodge. He was one of the heroes of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad and his innovative batting and excellent running the wickets saw him make the transition comfortably in the one-day game. However a sudden lapse in form during the 1983-84 season against Pakistan and West Indies saw him lose his place in the Test side and he never regained it, though he did play in a few one day games. Yashpal served as a national selector for a couple years until December 2005 and was reappointed to the panel in 2008.\n"", ' September 2008 \n']",[],37,59,11,1606,140,33.45,,,2,9,,7,16,0,42,40,9,883,89,28.48,1401,63.02,0,4,,,10,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,160,245,46,8933,201*,44.88,,,21,46,,,90,2,74,70,16,1859,91,34.42,,,0,12,,,28,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37,3,30,17,1,1/6,1/6,17,3.4,30,0,0,0,42,8,201,199,1,1/27,1/27,199,5.94,201,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,160,,3640,1584,47,5/106,,33.7,2.61,77.4,,1,0,74,,568,478,13,4/41,4/41,36.76,5.04,43.6,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A capable wicketkeeper with an excellent record of catches - keeping to Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma for Haryana must have\nhelped - Yadav was also a lower-order batsman who liked to score runs at a nifty rate. Indeed his batting and keeping seemed to be a natural for limited overs cricket and he did play in a good number of such games for the country in the early and mid 90s. He was given the big break in the one off Test against Zimbabwe in 1993 and performed creditably both behind the stumps and in front of them. \n', ""Yadav played a notable part in Haryana's Ranji Trophy triumph in 1990-91, getting runs handsomely and taking 24 catches and six stumpings.

What makes his ascent even more remarkable is that he represents unglamorous Vidarbha in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy. Yadav is the son of a coal-mine worker and was aiming to become a policeman. He only started considering a career in cricket as a 19-year-old, an age by which the best young Indian cricketers are in the running for a national cap.  \n', 'As a fast bowler, he has many skills: he regularly bowls at over 140kph, moves the ball both ways, and has a pretty effective bouncer. These qualities helped him take 20 wickets at 14.60 in four games for Vidarbha in his debut season in 2008-09. While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour. ', 'On that tour, a disastrous one for India, Umesh was one of few positives for the side, outbowling his more experienced team-mates to finish with 14 wickets from four Tests and a strike rate of 50.50. More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble. He returned to international cricket in June 2013 at the Champions Trophy in England, and a fast-bowler starved India would have heaved a collective sigh of relief to notice he had not lost his ability to bowl quick.', ""After continuing in the ODI circuit, both home and abroad, Umesh was picked for the Australia Tests in 2014 and he followed that up by becoming one of India's frontline bowlers at the 2015 World Cup, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker with 18 wickets at an average of 17.83.""]",[],41,47,21,283,30,10.88,643,44.01,0,0,31,9,14,0,75,24,14,79,18*,7.9,134,58.95,0,0,8,1,22,0,7,1,0,2,2,2,4,50,0,0,0,0,3,0,81,96,42,808,128*,14.96,1269,63.67,1,1,86,31,30,0,118,52,25,284,30,10.51,297,95.62,0,0,24,15,32,0,136,42,22,170,26,8.5,150,113.33,0,0,13,10,34,0,41,80,6659,3983,119,6/88,10/133,33.47,3.58,55.9,5,2,1,75,73,3558,3565,106,4/31,4/31,33.63,6.01,33.5,4,0,0,7,7,150,219,9,2/19,2/19,24.33,8.76,16.6,0,0,0,81,148,13945,7765,264,7/48,12/79,29.41,3.34,52.8,11,13,2,118,116,5682,5451,164,5/26,5/26,33.23,5.75,34.6,4,1,0,136,134,2817,3837,140,5/18,5/18,27.4,8.17,20.1,2,1,0

It was to the credit of this stout hearted cricketer that he more than held his own and commanded a more or less regular place in the Indian team till 1987. At the time of his last Test, his overall figures compared favourably with the best Indian spin bowlers. \n', 'An offspinner who possessed many fine qualities, Yadav was not afraid\nto flight the ball. He was never a big turner of the ball but had tremendous stamina, was steadiness personified and he was hardly ever collared. He made a striking debut when in his first series against Australia in 1979, he took 24 wickets in five Tests and his success led to the exclusion of Venkatraghavan.  He fitted in admirably with Shastri and Doshi to form the spin trio of the early 80s. He lost his place for a while but regained a spot when the West Indies toured India in 1983-84, picking up five for 131 in the first innings of the fourth Test at Bombay.  He was overshadowed by L Sivaramakrishnan against England in 1984-85 but was outstanding against Australia in 1985-86 picking up 15 wickets in the three Tests. This included a match haul of eight wickets in the final game at Sydney when he almost bowled India to victory. Used to long spells (he sent down 75 overs in one innings against Pakistan at Faisalabad in 1984) Yadav bowled 95.3 overs in this match. He again did well against the Australians in the return series in India in 1986-87 and later the same season registered his best innings figures of five for 76 against Sri Lanka at Nagpur.

He is a useful performer for Railways though, and has scored most of the runs as an opener. He missed his chance to be among the contenders for a place in India's World Cup squad but staked another claim with a fantastic allround performance in the 2004-05 domestic season where he topped the wicket-takers' list and was a talismanic figure for both Railways, who won the Ranji title, and Central Zone, who triumphed in the Duleep Trophy.
